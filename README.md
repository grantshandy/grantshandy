I'm a CS student at the University of Utah.
Most of my work is with Rust & Nix, but I'm always open to learn new things ðŸ˜Š (esp. functional languages).
I'm interested in programming language theory, compilers, webassembly, etc.

I'm currently pretty busy with schoolwork, so some of my projects are unfortunately on hold for major reworks.
I'll try to respond to issues/PRs as soon as possible.
